Completion of Final Project: Capstone, January 13, 2021


I learned a lot about the complete MERN Stack as it was my first real project on my own.  I used a dozen or more tutorials along with class notes and class projects to come up with my finished product.  The instructors were key at times when I exhausted everything I knew or didn't know to progress to the next step.  This is definitely not a production quality result as there needs to be some better use of the financial information, like a company search.  Also, I need to CSS/bootstrap better.  I may need to provide more than a blog maybe.  A newsletter may be a good addition.  The Alpha Vantage API is a powerful tool to access relevant and timely accounting information.  I am pleased to find about it and to maybe come up with a professional site in the future with the MERN stack and Alpha Vantage API.
